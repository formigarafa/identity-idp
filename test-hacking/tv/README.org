* Test data
All test data is stored under the ~test-data~ directory. Each rspec
run is stored in a subdirectory whose name is a GUID, used to identify
that test run. So the top-level data storage directory structure looks
like:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  test-data
    |
    +- 85cd2c44-51ab-41f9-8168-85ec91c93a46
    |
    +- 487997b0-efc2-4177-9d8a-86d20928aa43
#+END_EXAMPLE

Within each subdirectory, there are two files. Test run data get stored in
~test-run.json~. This is the exact JSON output produced by RSpec's
~--format=json~ (or ~-f json~) option. This is read-only data.

Other data for the test run (when and how it was imported, for now,
other things as needed) are stored in ~metadata.json~.

* Tests are slow
** If we only run fast tests, how much coverage do we have/lose -jmax
* Tests fail sometimes (are flaky)
** Especially bad on local machines; timing dependent?
** Known problem with JS tests randomly failing (Eric was last to trip over it, IIRC).
* Local test runs or CI test runs

* Re-gather test data without stupid application.yml settings - jmax


* Test spec/features/idv/doc_auth/send_link_step.rb:107
  _Lots_ of retries; why?
  IdentityConfig.store.idv_send_link_max_attempts
  Red herring; jmax-specific config.


* Identify shared examples and usage to prioritize speedup efforts

* Add warning (where?) about silly values in application.yml - Matt

* Automated run to identify flaky tests.
